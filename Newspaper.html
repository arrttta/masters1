            <h2>You end up a street where you find a newspaper</h2>
            <p>
                The first paragraph of the inland news reads as follows:
                <br>
                <br>
                The previous winter offered the public a cycle of public lectures, as had been customary for years in all major German cities. It is undoubtedly a step forward when, in addition to the demands for artistic enjoyment satisfied by theatre and concerts, the need for scientific intellectual nourishment also arises in wider circles.
                In this respect, the previous winter offered an extraordinary amount, and the numerous public, which gathered around the solid lectures of our most capable scholars in the previous autumn and winter, will certainly not fail to attend if they are offered something similar in the winter of 1862 to 1863. After all, new forces have flowed into our city in the form of the new professors of the Polytechnicum, whose work for the common good can be counted on! If it is the calling of our time to enable the whole of humanity to share in the goods of life which otherwise only individuals enjoy, then no opportunity should be missed from which one can expect progress in public education in the various areas of life. We therefore ask those men who have so successfully taken on the task of facilitating a cycle of public lectures to achieve the same for the current winter, and we do not doubt the willingness of those who are accustomed to serving the cause of the advancement of moral and intellectual education. Only where there is restless striving can success be foreseen, and with honest willing we will not fail to achieve what we are striving for.

                When you are done reading, you notice the same man who talked to you by the House of Black Heads.
                "Good things come to those who wait", he says. 
                "We are going to have our own university! Come, I will show you."
